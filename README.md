# About
Color generator program that sets background color to visualize and sets rgba values so users can copy it to use.

# Implementation
Coded in Visual Studio Code. HTML used as markup for display of rgba values used and setting the background to what those rgba combination looks like. 
Bootstrap was used to layout and style the user interface, Functionality was coded in TypeScript and then complied into JavaScript for a safer development.
Makes use of Math.random() and value 255 to generate random rgba values.
Useful as a copy and paste color generator to use for other applications as users can see what the color looks like and its values.
